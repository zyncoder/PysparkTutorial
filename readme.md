# PySpark Beginner's Session

Welcome to the PySpark Beginner's Session! This 2-day, hands-on training is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in working with Apache Spark using the Python API (PySpark). Whether you're new to Big Data or looking to expand your skills, this session will equip you with the essential knowledge and practical experience to kickstart your PySpark journey.

## Introduction

Apache Spark is a powerful open-source, distributed computing framework that enables efficient processing of large-scale data. PySpark, the Python API for Spark, allows you to leverage the power of Spark using the Python programming language, making it accessible and user-friendly.

In this session, you'll learn about the core concepts of Spark, including Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), DataFrames, Spark SQL, Streaming, and Machine Learning with MLlib. Through interactive lectures, hands-on exercises, and practical examples, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of PySpark and its applications in data processing, analytics, and machine learning.
