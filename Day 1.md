By integrating with Python, PySpark combines the power of Spark with the simplicity of Python, allowing for more efficient and accessible big data processing.

### Features

- **Distributed Processing**: Processes data across multiple nodes.
- **In-Memory Computing**: Keeps data in memory for faster processing.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies big data processing with high-level APIs.

## Why Use PySpark?

### Advantages

1. **Speed**: PySpark is known for its lightning-fast processing capabilities. It uses in-memory computing to increase the processing speed, making it much faster than traditional big data tools like Hadoop.

2. **Ease of Use**: PySpark offers an easy-to-use API in Python, which is a popular language among data scientists and analysts. This makes it easier to write code and integrate with other Python libraries.

3. **Scalability**: It can handle large datasets effortlessly, scaling from a single server to thousands of nodes.

4. **Unified Framework**: PySpark supports various big data operations such as SQL queries, streaming data, machine learning, and graph processing all in one place.

### Example: Word Count

Let's start with a simple example: a word count program in PySpark.

```python
from pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf

# Initialize SparkContext
conf = SparkConf().setAppName("WordCount").setMaster("local")
sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)

# Load data
text_file = sc.textFile("sample.txt")

# Perform word count
counts = (text_file.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" "))
                    .map(lambda word: (word, 1))
                    .reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b))

# Collect the results
output = counts.collect()

for (word, count) in output:
    print(f"{word}: {count}")

# Stop the SparkContext
sc.stop()
```

In this example, we initialize a SparkContext, read a text file, split the lines into words, map each word to a tuple (word, 1), reduce by key to count the occurrences of each word, and collect and print the results.

## Key Concepts in PySpark

### RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)

RDDs are the fundamental data structures of Spark. They are fault-tolerant, distributed collections of objects that can be processed in parallel.

#### Example: Creating an RDD

```python
# Initialize SparkContext
sc = SparkContext.getOrCreate()

# Create an RDD
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
rdd = sc.parallelize(data)

# Perform operations
squared = rdd.map(lambda x: x * x).collect()
print(squared)

# Stop the SparkContext
sc.stop()
```

### DataFrame

DataFrames are a higher-level abstraction compared to RDDs. They provide a more user-friendly API and are optimized for a wide range of data processing tasks.

#### Example: Creating a DataFrame

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DataFrameExample").getOrCreate()

# Create a DataFrame
data = [("Alice", 34), ("Bob", 45), ("Catherine", 29)]
columns = ["Name", "Age"]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

# Show the DataFrame
df.show()

# Stop the SparkSession
spark.stop()
```

### Spark SQL

Spark SQL is a module for structured data processing. It allows querying data via SQL as well as the DataFrame API.

#### Example: Running SQL Queries

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SparkSQLExample").getOrCreate()

# Create a DataFrame
data = [("Alice", 34), ("Bob", 45), ("Catherine", 29)]
columns = ["Name", "Age"]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

# Register the DataFrame as a SQL temporary view
df.createOrReplaceTempView("people")

# Execute SQL query
sqlDF = spark.sql("SELECT Name, Age FROM people WHERE Age > 30")
sqlDF.show()

# Stop the SparkSession
spark.stop()
```

### Machine Learning with PySpark (MLlib)

MLlib is Spark's scalable machine learning library. It provides tools for various machine learning tasks.

#### Example: Linear Regression

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression

# Initialize SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("LinearRegressionExample").getOrCreate()

# Create a DataFrame
data = [(1, 1.0), (2, 2.0), (3, 3.0), (4, 4.0), (5, 5.0)]
columns = ["id", "value"]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

# Assemble features
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["id"], outputCol="features")
assembled_df = assembler.transform(df)

# Train the model
lr = LinearRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="value")
lr_model = lr.fit(assembled_df)

# Print the coefficients and intercept
print(f"Coefficients: {lr_model.coefficients}")
print(f"Intercept: {lr_model.intercept}")

# Stop the SparkSession
spark.stop()
```

## Conclusion

PySpark is a powerful tool that combines the simplicity of Python with the robustness of Apache Spark. It is ideal for large-scale data processing and analytics, providing tools for everything from simple data manipulation to complex machine learning tasks. Its ability to scale, coupled with its ease of use, makes it a valuable asset for any data scientist or analyst working with big data.


Certainly! Below is a 15-minute overview of PySpark Data Structures, focusing on RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) and DataFrames, complete with code examples.

---

### PySpark Data Structures: RDDs and DataFrames

**Introduction to PySpark:**
PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, an open-source, distributed computing system. PySpark allows us to work with Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) and DataFrames, which are the primary data structures in Spark.

---

#### Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)

**1. Definition:**
RDDs are the fundamental data structure of Spark. They are immutable, distributed collections of objects that can be processed in parallel.

**2. Characteristics:**

**1. Fault-tolerant:**
RDDs provide fault tolerance through lineage. If a partition of an RDD is lost, Spark can recompute it using the transformations that originally created it. This is managed through the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that keeps track of transformations.

**Example:**
```python
# Initializing SparkContext
from pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf
conf = SparkConf().setAppName("FaultToleranceExample").setMaster("local")
sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)

# Creating an RDD from a list
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
rdd = sc.parallelize(data)

# Performing a transformation
squared_rdd = rdd.map(lambda x: x ** 2)

# If a node fails, Spark can recompute the lost data from the original RDD
```

**2. Immutable:**
Once created, RDDs cannot be altered. However, you can create new RDDs by applying transformations to existing ones. This immutability helps ensure consistency and fault tolerance.

**Example:**
```python
# RDDs are immutable
original_rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3])
squared_rdd = original_rdd.map(lambda x: x * x)

# original_rdd remains unchanged
print(original_rdd.collect())  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(squared_rdd.collect())   # Output: [1, 4, 9]
```

**3. Lazy Evaluation:**
RDD transformations are lazy, meaning they are not computed immediately. Instead, Spark builds an execution plan, which is only executed when an action is called.

**Example:**
```python
# Transformation (lazy)
lazy_rdd = rdd.map(lambda x: x + 2)

# Action (triggers computation)
print(lazy_rdd.collect())  # Output: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

**4. Partitioning:**
RDDs are automatically partitioned across different nodes in a cluster. You can also manually control the partitioning to optimize performance.

**Example:**
```python
# Specifying the number of partitions
partitioned_rdd = sc.parallelize(data, numSlices=4)
print(partitioned_rdd.getNumPartitions())  # Output: 4
```

**5. Caching:**
You can cache RDDs to speed up repeated computations. This is useful when the same RDD is accessed multiple times.

**Example:**
```python
# Caching an RDD
cached_rdd = squared_rdd.cache()

# Performing actions
print(cached_rdd.count())  # Triggers caching
print(cached_rdd.collect())  # Uses cached data
```

---

#### DataFrames

**1. Schema-based:**
DataFrames have a schema, which defines the structure of data in terms of column names and data types. This allows for more efficient querying and optimization.

**Example:**
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SchemaExample").getOrCreate()

data = [("Alice", 1), ("Bob", 2)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["Name", "Id"])

# Display schema
df.printSchema()
# Output:
# root
#  |-- Name: string (nullable = true)
#  |-- Id: long (nullable = true)
```

**2. Optimized Execution:**
DataFrames benefit from the Catalyst Optimizer, which optimizes query plans for execution. This can lead to significant performance improvements.

**Example:**
```python
# DataFrame with SQL optimization
df_filtered = df.filter(df["Id"] > 1)
df_filtered.show()
# The execution plan is optimized by Catalyst Optimizer
```

**3. Interoperability with SQL:**
DataFrames provide easy interoperability with SQL. You can run SQL queries directly on DataFrames using the Spark SQL API.

**Example:**
```python
# Register DataFrame as a temporary view
df.createOrReplaceTempView("people")

# Execute SQL query
sql_df = spark.sql("SELECT Name FROM people WHERE Id > 1")
sql_df.show()
```

**4. Distributed Processing:**
DataFrames, like RDDs, are distributed across the nodes of a cluster, enabling parallel processing and handling large datasets efficiently.

**Example:**
```python
# Creating a DataFrame from a large CSV file
large_df = spark.read.csv("path/to/largefile.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# DataFrame operations are distributed across the cluster
large_df.groupBy("column_name").count().show()
```

**5. Support for Various Data Sources:**
DataFrames can be created from various data sources including CSV, JSON, Parquet, databases, and more.

**Example:**
```python
# Reading from a JSON file
json_df = spark.read.json("path/to/file.json")

# Reading from a Parquet file
parquet_df = spark.read.parquet("path/to/file.parquet")

# Reading from a JDBC source
jdbc_df = spark.read.format("jdbc").option("url", "jdbc:mysql://localhost/db").option("dbtable", "table").option("user", "user").option("password", "password").load()
```

**6. Easy Integration with Machine Learning Libraries:**
DataFrames seamlessly integrate with Sparkâ€™s MLlib library, facilitating the building and evaluation of machine learning models.

**Example:**
```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression

# Sample DataFrame
data = [(1, 2, 1.0), (2, 3, 2.0), (3, 4, 3.0)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["feature1", "feature2", "label"])

# Assembling features into a feature vector
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["feature1", "feature2"], outputCol="features")
assembled_df = assembler.transform(df)

# Train a linear regression model
lr = LinearRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="label")
model = lr.fit(assembled_df)
print(model.coefficients)
```

**7. DataFrame API and Functionality:**
DataFrames provide a rich API for data manipulation including filtering, aggregation, joining, and more.

**Example:**
```python
# Aggregation example
df.groupBy("Name").sum("Id").show()

# Join example
other_data = [("Alice", "F"), ("Bob", "M")]
other_df = spark.createDataFrame(other_data, ["Name", "Gender"])
joined_df = df.join(other_df, on="Name", how="inner")
joined_df.show()
```

---

Understanding these characteristics allows you to choose the appropriate data structure (RDDs or DataFrames) based on your use case, optimize your Spark jobs, and leverage the full power of PySpark.

**3. Creating RDDs:**
RDDs can be created from a local collection or external datasets such as HDFS, S3, or HBase.

```python
from pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf

# Initialize SparkContext
conf = SparkConf().setAppName("RDDExample").setMaster("local")
sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)

# Creating RDD from a Python list
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
rdd = sc.parallelize(data)

# Creating RDD from an external text file
rdd2 = sc.textFile("path/to/textfile.txt")
```

**4. Transformations and Actions:**
Transformations are operations on RDDs that return a new RDD, such as `map` and `filter`. Actions are operations that return a result, such as `collect` and `count`.

```python
# Transformation: map
squared_rdd = rdd.map(lambda x: x ** 2)

# Action: collect
squared_data = squared_rdd.collect()
print(squared_data)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

**5. Example: Word Count**
A common example to illustrate RDDs is the word count problem.

```python
# Read text file into RDD
text_rdd = sc.textFile("path/to/textfile.txt")

# Transformations
words = text_rdd.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" "))
word_pairs = words.map(lambda word: (word, 1))
word_counts = word_pairs.reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)

# Action
result = word_counts.collect()
for word, count in result:
    print(f"{word}: {count}")
```

---

#### DataFrames

**1. Definition:**
DataFrames are a higher-level abstraction compared to RDDs, inspired by data frames in R and Python (Pandas). They are distributed collections of data organized into named columns.

**2. Characteristics:**
- Provides a schema view of data
- Optimized execution plan using Catalyst Optimizer
- Can be created from various sources (e.g., CSV, JSON, databases)

**3. Creating DataFrames:**
DataFrames can be created from RDDs, structured data files, or external databases.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DataFrameExample").getOrCreate()

# Creating DataFrame from a local collection
data = [("Alice", 1), ("Bob", 2), ("Cathy", 3)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["Name", "Id"])

# Creating DataFrame from a CSV file
df_csv = spark.read.csv("path/to/file.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
```

**4. DataFrame Operations:**
DataFrames provide a domain-specific language for structured data manipulation, similar to SQL.

```python
# Show the DataFrame
df.show()

# Select columns
df.select("Name").show()

# Filter rows
df.filter(df["Id"] > 1).show()

# Group by and aggregate
df.groupBy("Name").count().show()
```

**5. SQL Queries:**
Spark SQL allows us to run SQL queries on DataFrames.

```python
# Register DataFrame as a temporary view
df.createOrReplaceTempView("people")

# SQL query
sql_df = spark.sql("SELECT Name FROM people WHERE Id > 1")
sql_df.show()
```

**6. Example: Analyzing a JSON Dataset**
```python
# Read JSON data into DataFrame
json_df = spark.read.json("path/to/file.json")

# Show schema
json_df.printSchema()

# Select and filter data
json_df.select("name", "age").filter(json_df["age"] > 25).show()
```

**7. Converting between RDDs and DataFrames:**
You can easily convert between RDDs and DataFrames.

```python
# RDD to DataFrame
rdd_to_df = rdd.map(lambda x: (x, x**2)).toDF(["Number", "Square"])

# DataFrame to RDD
df_to_rdd = df.rdd
```

---

**Conclusion:**
- RDDs provide low-level operations and control over data manipulation.
- DataFrames offer higher-level abstractions, optimizations, and ease of use.
- PySparkâ€™s flexibility allows for seamless conversion between RDDs and DataFrames, making it a powerful tool for big data processing and analytics.

By understanding these two core data structures, you can effectively leverage PySpark for a wide range of data processing tasks.

# Transformations and Actions in PySpark

PySpark, the Python API for Apache Spark, allows for distributed data processing. In PySpark, operations on data can be classified into two categories: transformations and actions. Understanding these two types of operations is essential for efficient use of PySpark.

#### Transformations
Transformations are operations on RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) or DataFrames that return another RDD or DataFrame. Transformations are lazy, meaning they don't execute until an action is called. This allows Spark to optimize the overall data processing workflow.

##### 1. map
The `map` transformation applies a function to each element of the RDD and returns a new RDD with the results.

```python
from pyspark import SparkContext

sc = SparkContext("local", "Map Example")
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
rdd = sc.parallelize(data)
mapped_rdd = rdd.map(lambda x: x * 2)
print(mapped_rdd.collect())  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

##### 2. filter
The `filter` transformation returns a new RDD containing only the elements that satisfy a given condition.

```python
filtered_rdd = rdd.filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
print(filtered_rdd.collect())  # Output: [2, 4]
```

##### 3. flatMap
The `flatMap` transformation is similar to `map`, but each input item can be mapped to zero or more output items (i.e., it can return a list of elements).

```python
lines = sc.parallelize(["hello world", "foo bar"])
words = lines.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" "))
print(words.collect())  # Output: ['hello', 'world', 'foo', 'bar']
```

##### 4. distinct
The `distinct` transformation returns a new RDD with distinct elements from the original RDD.

```python
data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
rdd = sc.parallelize(data)
distinct_rdd = rdd.distinct()
print(distinct_rdd.collect())  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

##### 5. union
The `union` transformation returns a new RDD containing all elements from two RDDs.

```python
rdd1 = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3])
rdd2 = sc.parallelize([3, 4, 5])
union_rdd = rdd1.union(rdd2)
print(union_rdd.collect())  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
```

#### Actions
Actions are operations that trigger the execution of transformations and return a result to the driver program or write data to external storage.

##### 1. collect
The `collect` action returns all the elements of the RDD as a list to the driver program.

```python
result = rdd.collect()
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

##### 2. count
The `count` action returns the number of elements in the RDD.

```python
count = rdd.count()
print(count)  # Output: 5
```

##### 3. first
The `first` action returns the first element of the RDD.

```python
first_element = rdd.first()
print(first_element)  # Output: 1
```

##### 4. take
The `take` action returns the first `n` elements of the RDD.

```python
first_two = rdd.take(2)
print(first_two)  # Output: [1, 2]
```

##### 5. reduce
The `reduce` action reduces the elements of the RDD using a specified binary operator.

```python
from operator import add

sum = rdd.reduce(add)
print(sum)  # Output: 15
```

##### 6. saveAsTextFile
The `saveAsTextFile` action saves the RDD to a text file, with each element of the RDD written to a separate line.

```python
rdd.saveAsTextFile("output.txt")
```

### Putting It All Together
Let's combine some transformations and actions to perform a simple workflow.

```python
data = ["hello world", "this is a test", "hello PySpark"]

# Parallelize data
rdd = sc.parallelize(data)

# Apply transformations
words = rdd.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" "))  # Split lines into words
filtered_words = words.filter(lambda word: word != "a")  # Filter out the word "a"
word_pairs = filtered_words.map(lambda word: (word, 1))  # Map words to (word, 1) pairs

# Perform an action
word_count = word_pairs.reduceByKey(add)  # Reduce by key to count words

# Collect and print result
result = word_count.collect()
print(result)  # Output: [('hello', 2), ('world', 1), ('this', 1), ('is', 1), ('test', 1), ('PySpark', 1)]
```

### Conclusion
Understanding transformations and actions in PySpark is crucial for efficient data processing. Transformations are lazy and build up a lineage of RDDs, while actions trigger the execution of this lineage to produce results or write data. By combining transformations and actions, we can perform complex data processing workflows in a distributed manner.

In PySpark, schema definition and manipulation are essential tasks when working with structured data, particularly when dealing with DataFrames or structured data sources like CSV, JSON, or Parquet files. Let's delve into schema definition and manipulation in PySpark with code examples for each concept.

# Schema Definition

Schema defines the structure of the data that you want to work with. It specifies the names of columns and their data types. In PySpark, schemas can be defined explicitly or inferred from data sources.

#### Explicit Schema Definition

To define a schema explicitly in PySpark, you typically use the `StructType` and `StructField` classes from the `pyspark.sql.types` module.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType

# Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SchemaExample").getOrCreate()

# Define the schema
schema = StructType([
    StructField("id", IntegerType(), True),
    StructField("name", StringType(), True),
    StructField("age", IntegerType(), True)
])

# Read data with the defined schema
df = spark.read.csv("data.csv", schema=schema)

# Show the DataFrame
df.show()
```

In this example:
- We define a schema with three fields: `id` (IntegerType), `name` (StringType), and `age` (IntegerType).
- We read a CSV file (`data.csv`) using this schema, ensuring that the data types are enforced during the read operation.

### Schema Manipulation

Schema manipulation involves altering or transforming an existing schema or DataFrame structure. PySpark provides methods to add, drop, or change columns in a DataFrame.

#### Adding a Column

To add a new column to an existing DataFrame in PySpark:

```python
# Adding a new column
df_with_new_column = df.withColumn("new_column", df["age"] + 10)
df_with_new_column.show()
```

In this example, `df.withColumn()` adds a new column `new_column` that is derived from the existing `age` column by adding 10 to each value.

#### Dropping a Column

To drop a column from a DataFrame:

```python
# Dropping a column
df_without_column = df.drop("age")
df_without_column.show()
```

Here, `df.drop()` removes the `age` column from the DataFrame `df`.

#### Changing Data Types

To change the data type of a column in a DataFrame:

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Changing data type of a column
df_with_changed_type = df.withColumn("id_str", col("id").cast(StringType()))
df_with_changed_type.show()
```

In this example, `col("id").cast(StringType())` changes the data type of the `id` column from IntegerType to StringType, and the result is stored in a new column `id_str`.

### Conclusion

Schema definition and manipulation are fundamental operations when working with structured data in PySpark. Explicit schema definition ensures data integrity and efficient processing, while schema manipulation allows for flexible data transformations as per analytical requirements. Understanding these concepts and their implementation in PySpark is crucial for effective data processing pipelines and analytics workflows.

# Basic DataFrame Operation Programming Problems in PySpark

Here are ten programming problems to help you practice basic DataFrame operations in PySpark:

#### Problem 1: Create a DataFrame
**Task:** Create a DataFrame from a list of tuples containing names and ages. The DataFrame should have two columns: "name" and "age".

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("CreateDataFrame").getOrCreate()
data = [("Alice", 29), ("Bob", 34), ("Cathy", 25)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["name", "age"])
df.show()
```

#### Problem 2: Select Columns
**Task:** Select and show only the "name" column from the DataFrame.

```python
df.select("name").show()
```

#### Problem 3: Filter Rows
**Task:** Filter the DataFrame to show only rows where age is greater than 30.

```python
df.filter(df["age"] > 30).show()
```

#### Problem 4: Add a Column
**Task:** Add a new column "age_plus_ten" which is the age column increased by 10.

```python
df.withColumn("age_plus_ten", df["age"] + 10).show()
```

#### Problem 5: Group By and Aggregate
**Task:** Create a new DataFrame with an additional column "department". Group by "department" and calculate the average age for each department.

```python
data_with_department = [("Alice", 29, "HR"), ("Bob", 34, "IT"), ("Cathy", 25, "HR")]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data_with_department, ["name", "age", "department"])
df.groupBy("department").avg("age").show()
```

#### Problem 6: Sort Data
**Task:** Sort the DataFrame by age in descending order.

```python
df.orderBy(df["age"].desc()).show()
```

#### Problem 7: Join DataFrames
**Task:** Create another DataFrame with "name" and "salary" columns. Perform an inner join on the "name" column.

```python
salary_data = [("Alice", 5000), ("Bob", 6000), ("David", 7000)]
df_salary = spark.createDataFrame(salary_data, ["name", "salary"])
df.join(df_salary, on="name", how="inner").show()
```

#### Problem 8: Drop a Column
**Task:** Drop the "age_plus_ten" column from the DataFrame created in Problem 4.

```python
df_with_new_column = df.withColumn("age_plus_ten", df["age"] + 10)
df_with_new_column.drop("age_plus_ten").show()
```

#### Problem 9: Rename a Column
**Task:** Rename the "age" column to "years".

```python
df.withColumnRenamed("age", "years").show()
```

#### Problem 10: Handle Missing Data
**Task:** Create a DataFrame with some missing values. Fill missing values in the "age" column with the average age.

```python
data_with_missing = [("Alice", 29), ("Bob", None), ("Cathy", 25)]
df_missing = spark.createDataFrame(data_with_missing, ["name", "age"])
average_age = df_missing.selectExpr("avg(age)").collect()[0][0]
df_missing.fillna({"age": average_age}).show()
```

### Conclusion
These problems cover various basic operations on DataFrames in PySpark, such as creation, selection, filtering, adding columns, grouping, sorting, joining, dropping, renaming, and handling missing data. Practicing these will help you get a solid understanding of PySpark DataFrame operations.
